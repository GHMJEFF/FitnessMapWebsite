        <h2>Lower Body Workouts</h2>
        <p>Building a solid lower body is key to improving overall strength and power. From everyday movements like walking to advanced sports activities, a strong lower body improves balance and power. The following workouts focus on your legs and core.</p>

        <div class="workout-section">
            <h3>Quadriceps and Hamstrings</h3>
            <p><strong>Squats</strong> - Squats are the ultimate full-leg workout, engaging the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core.</p>
            <p>Form Tip: Maintain a neutral spine, push through your heels, and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground.</p>
            <img src="https://training.fit/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kniebeugen-langhantel.png" height="300" width="300" alt="Squat Exercise">

            <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Deadlifts</strong> - One of the best compound exercises, deadlifts work the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back, promoting overall strength and stability.</p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">Form Tip: Keep the bar close to your body, drive through your heels, and lift with your legs, not your back.</p>
            <img src="https://training.fit/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deadlift-kreuzheben.png" height="300" width="300" style="float: right;" alt="Deadlift Exercise">

            <p><strong>Lunges</strong> - Lunges are an excellent unilateral exercise, meaning each leg works independently, helping to correct any strength imbalances. These can be done with a barbell, dumbbells, or without any weight at all.</p>
            <p>Form Tip: Keep your chest up, core engaged, and take a large step forward, lowering your back knee towards the ground. This can be with both dumbbells and barbells.</p>

            <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Leg Extensions</strong> - This machine-based exercise targets the quadriceps and helps to isolate them for better muscle definition and strength.</p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">Form Tip: Adjust the machine so that your knees are aligned with the pivot point, and extend your legs fully, keeping the motion slow and controlled.</p>

            <p><strong>Leg Curls</strong> - Leg curls focus on the hamstrings, providing balance between the front and back of the thighs for overall leg strength.</p>
            <p>Form Tip: Adjust the machine pad so that it rests just above your ankles, and curl your legs slowly, focusing on squeezing your hamstrings.</p>

        <div class="workout-section">
            <h3>Glutes</h3>
            <p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Hip Thrusts</strong> - Hip thrusts are fantastic for isolating the glutes and building posterior chain strength. They can be done on a machine but your gym may not have that. Instead, you can also do it with a barbell and a bench.</p>
            <p style="text-align: right;">Form Tip: Keep your back against a bench and drive your hips upwards, squeezing your glutes at the top.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Bulgarian Split Squats</strong> - Another fantastic unilateral exercise, the Bulgarian split squat heavily targets the glutes, quads, and hamstrings.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Form Tip: Elevate your rear foot on a bench, keep your core tight, and lower your hips until your front thigh is parallel to the ground.</p>
