        <h2>Lower Body Workouts</h2>
        <p>Building a solid lower body is key to improving overall strength and power. From everyday movements like walking to advanced sports activities, a strong lower body improves balance and power. The following workouts focus on your legs and core.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Quadriceps and Hamstrings</h3>
            <div class="workout-section">
                <p><strong>Squats</strong> - Squats are the ultimate full-leg workout, engaging the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core.</p>
                <p>Form Tip: Maintain a neutral spine, push through your heels, and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="workout-section">
                <p class="text-right"><strong>Deadlifts</strong> - One of the best compound exercises, deadlifts work the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back, promoting overall strength and stability.</p>
                <p class="text-right">Form Tip: Keep the bar close to your body, drive through your heels, and lift with your legs, not your back.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="workout-section">
                <p><strong>Lunges</strong> - Lunges are an excellent unilateral exercise, meaning each leg works independently, helping to correct any strength imbalances. These can be done with a barbell, dumbbells, or without any weight at all.</p>
                <p>Form Tip: Keep your chest up, core engaged, and take a large step forward, lowering your back knee towards the ground. This can be with both dumbbells and barbells.</p>

            <h3>Glutes</h3>
            <div class="workout-section">
                <p class="text-right"><strong>Hip Thrusts</strong> - Hip thrusts are fantastic for isolating the glutes and building posterior chain strength. They can be done on a machine, or you can use a barbell and a bench.</p>
                <p class="text-right">Form Tip: Keep your back against a bench and drive your hips upwards, squeezing your glutes at the top.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="workout-section">
                <p class="text-left"><strong>Bulgarian Split Squats</strong> - Another fantastic unilateral exercise, the Bulgarian split squat heavily targets the glutes, quads, and hamstrings.</p>
                <p class="text-left">Form Tip: Elevate your rear foot on a bench, keep your core tight, and lower your hips until your front thigh is parallel to the ground.</p>
